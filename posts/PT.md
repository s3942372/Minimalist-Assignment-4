# Punchin' Time! Reflection

## The Plan

For assignment 3, we had to develop 3 games that persuade the players of something. Looking at the different topics available (persuasive games, micro-games, microcinema, etc.) I decided to focus on the topic of persuasive games for all 3 of the games I was developing. This project, 'Punchin' Time!', is the third and final one I developed. The concept itself is about school violence, specifically that of bullying and a cause of it. This one is also based on personal experience (that of watching my friends in a international primary school absolutely wallop each other in the name of nothing more than boredom), though school violence can occur anywhere, at anytime.

## The Process

For this game, I had conducted research on school violence and bullying, and how boredom is a cause that can lead to it. In my own experience, my friends never bullied each other (since being bullied does suggest an inability to fight back, and boy did my friends fight back), but instead had instigated fights with one another due to a myriad of reasons - most notably that of boredom. As such, I wanted to try and create a game about this and convince the players of a few things:
- Sometimes bullying occurs for no other reason than boredom
- Often it is harder to stop than to start/continue this behaviour
- Everyone is capable of this

I decided to make another clicker game for this, this time, one that resembles those addictive cookie clicker games. Only instead of clicking a cookie, you are a bully 'punching' a person's (Harper again, so sorry Harper) face. There are upgrades available, and Harper will have dialogue and image changes based on how much you've punched and for how long. Everything about this game is designed to make players want to keep 'punching' Harper.

There are in fact two paths to this game: players can choose to punch Harper as stated previously, or they can leave Harper be. This second option also has results, in that after a certain amount of time Harper begins opening up to the player and starts becoming their friend, looking more and more happy. This path however, would be designed to be hidden, players will not be told to do this, and there will be no visual cues for this path; players would have to come up with it themselves. Furthermore, if the players 'punch' Harper even ince while on this path, then it is softlocked forever: players are put on the more violent route and can't go back unless they restart the game.

For this game, I had decided to keep using the engine 'Scratch' to make it, as at this point I was in too deep to change. Also since all 3 of my persuasive games are simple in gameplay and visuals, 'Scratch' suited my needs perfectly as an engine I can quickly create games despite having very limited experience with it. I took Harper's premade asset and deleted everthing other than their face, and put it together with the background image of a school into the game editor. I then also started drawing out the rest of the assets I needed: the upgrades, the 'blood' Harper 'bleeds', as well as their different expressions for both routes.

I then started the 'coding'. I made it so that Harper's face bobbles around in the middle of the screen so that they were hard to ignore. If players move their cursor over Harper, their face would become bigger, practically inviting the users to click on them. I also made it so that the upgrade items are also constantly vibrating, drawing the players' attention. I also added two point systems in the upper left corner. The first one keeps track of how many times you've clicked on (hit) Harper. The other determines the amount of damage you do. You start off with 1 damage equating to 1 hit, but as you build up hits you can exchange them for one of the upgrade items, increasing your damage. This is to make players want to click more, and once they start seeing the visual changes on Harper, get them addicted enough to keep going.

The gameplay mechanic is simply clicking, constant clicking. It ensures that the players enters a 'zone' or a state where they've stopped really considering what they're doing and what it represents, and the dopamine of getting the upgrades and seeing the changes in Harper from the hits makes sure that they feel inclined to 'hurt' Harper. After all, why should they care about what they're doing and who they're doing it to? The players don't even learn of Harper's name unless they've entered the non-violent route and Harper introduces themselves.

The game also has no ending - this is to ensure that sooner or later, even the players who choose not to 'hit' Harper will get bored and end up clicking just to relieve their boredom anyways.

I implemented music in the background, as well as both a sound and visual effect that occurs when Harper is 'hit' (the sound of slapping, and blood falling out of Harper). If you are on the non-violent route (which takes at least 50 seconds for there to be a visual difference and showing players that there is another path available), then the music remains cheerful and happy, reflecting on Harper's state as they become happier and happier. If you are on the violent rounte however, the music undergoes a change as well, reflecting on Harper's damaged state. The music starts lowering in pitch more and more, until it becomes this droning sound that brings unease to the players. Togther with Harper's last available expression for the violent route (a damaged face with a deadened stare), this is meant to be a rude awakening for players - for them to come to the realisation of what exactly they've done, and easily they've been lead into doing it. The dialogue that appears while getting to this last expression also adds to the horror of what the players have done. Harper constantly asked them to stop, but they didn't.

Part of this assignment was needing to collect feedback. This was by far the most popular and highly rated game of the three I had for this assignment, with everyone that has played it highly enjoying the game, finding the mechanics easy to understand, as well as understanding what they are being persuaded of through the game. some of the only critiques given were that the game was a bit repetitive (done so on purpose to desensitise players to what they're doing) and that players wanted more reactions which I've added.

## The Outcome

'Punchin' Time!' was strongest in both concept, narrative and gameplay than the rest. From the feedback given for the assignment, "the main idea that [ I've ] latched onto and advanced in [ my ] work is how [ I ] can manipulate the user’s desire to ‘win’ — or even to simply interact — to guide them towards destructive behaviours that [ I ] want to highlight."

Out of my 3 games, This one was definitely the most 'complete', and I found it fitting to be the last work in the line of 6 interactive works - it is my best work, and so users can see how I've grown and developed in my abilities and concepts over time.

If I had more time, I would likely try and further improve it, add more dialogue and responses, however as it currently is, I think it stands just fine. It is the work I am the most proud of, and I am happy I am finishing with this one.
