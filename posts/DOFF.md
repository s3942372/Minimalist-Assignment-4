# Drifting Off Reflection

## The Plan

For assignment 3, we had to develop 3 games that persuade the players of something. Looking at the different topics available (persuasive games, micro-games, microcinema, etc.) I decided to focus on the topic of persuasive games for all 3 of the games I was developing. This project, 'Drifitng Off', is the second one I developed. Originally, the concept was about procrastination, before I shifted and changed the topic to be based on the personal experience of trying to complete homework and my assignments while sleep deprived, drifting in and out of consciousness, and the inevitable outcome of falling asleep while still working. I found it easier to think up a game meant to persuade players that sleep is important, that they should always get enough sleep - especially when working on a project or assignment of some sort, and that if they don't then inevitably one day they'll end up missing an important deadline or be unable to hand something in (I may or may not have a few personal experiences with this).

## The Process

For this game, I had conducted research on sleep and how sleep deprivation impacts work and found that yes, true to my own experience, sleep deprivation can negatively impact your ability to finish tasks on time. I then decided that I wanted to persuade players of this through a clicker game - the objective is for users to pop as many 'dream clouds' as fast as possible, if too many are on the screen then its a game over. Like so, the players will be constantly clicking to pop the clouds. However, other than the game-over screen, the game is endless. Inevitably the player will get tired of constantly clicking and enough clouds will fill up the screen to get a game over. This reflects how even if you are able to fight against falling asleep, you won't be able to for long, and one day, you will fall asleep while working and be negatively impacted by that. It will happen to you, it's just a matter of time.

For this game, I had decided to keep using the engine 'Scratch' to make it, as I was slowly starting to grow more and more familiar with the engine. Since all 3 of my persuasive games are simple in gameplay and visuals, 'Scratch' suited my needs perfectly as an engine I can quickly create games despite having very limited experience with it. I found the premade asset of a duck(?), and imported it into my game editor. I then start drawing out the other visual assets I needed in 'Scratch' such as the background elements of the bookshelf and the clock, as well as foreground elements of the desk, book and pencil. I also drew out the clouds that players will need to pop. Finally, I finished with drawing out the different positions the duck needed to transition between throughout the game as well as the game over screen.

I then started the 'coding'. I made it so that the clouds will generate at random times and drift around at random speeds. The duck itself (representing me and the player and everyone who works while sleep deprived) cycles between different states of awake, drifting off, asleep and awake again. The clock in the background too was made to resembles a cuckoo clock, and every few seconds will open its little doors to reveal a tiny duck inside. This was made to often coincide with the frame of the duck waking up from its sleep to make it seem like its the clock sounding and waking the duck up.

I made it so that the cursor resembles the pencil that the duck is holding, and made it so that every few seconds, if there are more than 10 clouds on screen it will drift off in a random direction. The pencil itself also leaves behind a trail of black dots (because I couldn't figure out how to make it a black line) to represent the experience of accidently scribbling onto your homework because you're so sleep deprived you've lost your grip on your pencil/pen and it's just pressed into the paper and the ink/graphite is being transferred on all over the place.

I then made it so that the game-over screen appears if there are more than 20 clouds present on screen and added some music to play on loop throughout the entire game. I also added a 'pop' sound effect whenever you 'pop' one of the clouds. The clouds are also made to constantly change in colour, giving it a slight psychedelic, loopy effect (how I feel when I am severely sleep deprived really. Also according to my psychology teacher back in grade 11, driving while sleep deprived has similar effects to the brain as driving while under the influence, so I thought that this was a nice call back to that class. Not that anyone would know).

![Lines and Game Overs](/assignment3/doff4.png)

This game is technically never-ending, and only has the game-over screen where you lose. The reason for this is to convince players that it's not good to be sleep deprived while working and that no matter what, you *will* lose the fight against sleep. It's inevitable. You *can't* win. You will keep popping the clouds until finally, your hands get tired, or you get bored, or you can't keep up anymore, and then too many clouds will fill up the screen and you will get a game over.

Part of this assignment was needing to collect feedback. Unfortunately, much of the feedback given was when the game itself was still about procrastinaation and not sleep deprivation and so certain elements such as the gameover screen and the cyclical shift in image between awake and asleep was not implemented yet. Despite this, for the previous version, most players have enjoyed the game and found the gameplay mechanics easy to understand, and can see that the game was a persuasive game. What players didn't really like was the repetitive nature of the game as well as a few other points that, after having changed the theme of the game, made more sense to have as a design for.

## The Outcome

'Drifting Off' was stronger in concept and gameplay than 'My Dress Up Doll', but still most definitely weaker than that of 'Punchin' Time!'. From the feedback given from the assignment it was apparent that the visuals for this game took away certain elements and were a bit distracting. It also made it seem like it was about working and getting distracted, not sleep deprivation. This is mostly because I did shift from the concept being about porcrastination to sleep deprivation, as well as the visual elements of the clouds were representative of the feeling you get when sleep deprived, of feeling muddled and fuzzy and the longer you stayed awake the more 'clouded' and heavy your brain feels. Looking back now, perhaps I could add a filter that transitions in and out of focus to reflect this, or change the game to be in first person mode where you have to constantly click to fight to stay awake instead.

Out of my 3 games, This one was definitely more of a middle ground bridging between 'My Dress Up Doll' and 'Punchin' Time!' Gameplay wise, it retains much of its limited functions in that you can only click and watch as something happens, but there is much more going on on the screen. It feels more 'complete'.

Although this work was somewhat less narrative focused than my other game 'Drifting Off', it was more engaging and fun as a game, so I had placed it after the other. It can be considered my second most complete work, and I do think that it is able to stand on its own as a short little micro-game of sorts (even if it wasn't the most persuasive). I suppose much like 'My Dress Up Doll', it is a bit too abstract(?) and require too much thought into what the game is about to work effectively as a persuasive game.
