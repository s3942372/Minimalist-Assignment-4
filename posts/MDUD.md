# My Dress Up Doll Reflection

## The Plan

For assignment 3, we had to develop 3 games that persuade the players of something. Looking at the different topics available (persuasive games, micro-games, microcinema, etc.) I decided to focus on the topic of persuasive games for all 3 of the games I was developing. This project, 'My Dress Up Doll', is placed before the other two because it was developed first. Its concept is based on the personal experience of being told what to wear - and, to a lesser degree - being told who to be. The game takes place in a bedroon setting, with a pre-teen called Harper. Although not mentioned, the player is actually playing from the perspective of Harper's mom. What I am trying to persuade the players is that you should not *control* another person's identity.

## The Process

As persuasive games are often used to make statements - and I *am* making a statement - I had to conduct research to ensure I understand the topic I was going to convince people of. I have chosen the topic of identity because it was something personal to each individual, and people often hate it when others try and dictate their identity for them. My research lead me to finding the importance of identity in clothing, how what you wear changes another's perception of you. Clothing is, in a way, a somewhat intimate way of getting to know another person. Similarly, a person's identity is practically always influenced by the people around them - most notably those who raised them. I wanted to pit these two concepts against each other, and adding in personal experience and that of some of my friends, I decided to make a 'dress-up' game.

For this game, I had decided to use the engine 'Scratch' to make it, having been introduced to the engine during one of the weekly lectures. It is basically a simplified method of coding, which I needed and wanted desperately after the failure that was my 'Hint Fiction' work. I found the premade assests of a bedroom background, clothing, as well as Harper, and brought them all into the game editor, before cutting them apart into individual sections such as headpieces, right arm, left arm, torso, hair, etc. I then added several different expressions that Harper could change into overtime as the game went on.

I then started the 'coding'. I made it so that each time a part of Harper is clicked on, it can change. I also gave instructions to click on Harper's clothes. The intention was for the players to click on the clothes first, like a normal dress up game, before they accidentally click on one of Harper's limbs or their face and find out that they can change that too.

I then added code so that the more time you spend on clicking Harper and the more clicks you make, the more upset Harper's expression becomes, with the final expression being them crying over what the player is doing.

I had originally considered doing an alternative ending, where, if the player leaves Harper alone for a loong enough period of time, then Harper becomes happier and dresses themselves. I wasn't able to do this, as I had already cut Harper up and this being my first time using Scratch, I wasn't able to make it so that Harper changed clothes after having nothing done to them. I did however make it so that their starting expression was a happy-looking one, so users had two choices: either leave Harper be and they keep that happy expression, or start clicking and watch as over time they get more and more upset.

I chose to not add any music to this game, as I thought that in a way, this was the most serious and personal persuasive game, and so I should not have any elements that take away from it. Similarly, why the other two faces Harper's could change into are ill-fitting is the idea that the players are fully forcing them to be someone else. The players are not meant to be comfortable looking at it, the way you might not be comfortable looking at someone who's pretending to be someone else in real life.

Part of this assignment was needing to collect feedback. Most players have enjoyed the game and found the gameplay mechanics easy to understand, and that the game was a persuasive game. Parts that were frustrating to players were the layers of the changeable items, of which I tried to fix for the clothing layers and left as is for the body parts as those were meant to be that way. Once I finished editing the game in response to the feedback I decided to move on to working on the rest of assignment 3.

## The Outcome

'My Dress Up Doll' was definitely the weakest conceptually of my 3 persuasive games as it was the first one I worked on, as well as the first time I tried 'Scratch' out. It was a fun experiment on how I can place a darker theme in an otherwise cheerful-looking, innocuous dress-up game.

Out of my 3 works, players did understand this the least and found it the least fun, which was understandable, as it does have very limited function (just clicking and seeing the parts change) and a statement that needed to be thought about alot to be understood. For example, one player commented on how they would like for there to be an achievement sound for when clothes match - which, while one could say that they came into the role of the 'guardian/parent' quite well, it also meant that they did not manage to fully understand what the game is trying to convince them of.

This game used to be called 'Who Are They?' to make players question Harper's identity, and to make it more obvious that they are the ones deciding that. The name was later changed to 'My Dress Up Doll' to reflect how often, children (and others) are unable to prevent others (whether it's their guardian or parent or someone else) from deciding for them who they are. Harper is referred to as a 'doll' here to represent their inability to fight back, and how those in a position of power over them (again, parents and guardians in this game) often influence and choose their identity for them. Of course, this is not always the case everywhere in the world. However, the game was based on my experience in China and what I've seen of others - one could say it is a hyperbolic work.

Although this wrk was somewhat more narrative focused than my other game 'Drifting Off', it wasn't as fun or engaging as a game, so I had placed it before the other. I do think that it was a good middle ground as I transition into the more narrative and gameplay focused works that are the last two games though.
